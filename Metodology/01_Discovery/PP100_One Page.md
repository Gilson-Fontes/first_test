# PP100_One Page PROJECT NAME
_Simplified document with the informations crucial to the beginning of the solution study_

## BUSINESS CONTEXT
* What is target definition 
* What are inputs (description)
* What kind of model was built?

## Metrics
* What are the qualitative objectives? (e.g. reduce turnnover)
* What is a quantifiable metric  (e.g. reduce the fraction of users with 4-week inactivity)
* Quantify what improvement in the values of the metrics are useful for the customer scenario (e.g. reduce the  fraction of users with 4-week inactivity by 20%) 
* What is the baseline (current) value of the metric? (e.g. current fraction of users with 4-week inactivity = 60%)
* How will we measure the metric? (e.g. A/B test on a specified subset for a specified period; or comparison of performance after implementation to baseline)

## Business background
* Who is the client, what business domain the client is in.
* What business problems are we trying to address?

## Scope
* What data science solutions are we trying to build?
* What will we do?
* How is it going to be consumed by the customer?
* Do we need all the data?
* Identify type of problem: prototyping, proof of concept, root cause analysis, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, machine-to-machine implementation
* How accurate the solution needs to be?
* How granular?

## Architecture
* First version architecture design

## Architecture
* Data
  * What data do we expect? Raw data in the customer data sources (e.g. on-prem files, SQL, on-prem Hadoop etc.)
* Data movement from on-prem to Azure using ADF or other data movement tools (Azcopy, EventHub etc.) to move either
  * all the data, 
  * after some pre-aggregation on-prem,
  * Sampled data enough for modeling

## Features
* Get specifications, requirements, priorities, budgets
* Built internally versus using a vendor solution

## Personnel
* Who are on this project:
	* Braskem
		* Project lead
		* PM
		* Data scientist(s)
		* Account manager
	* Client:
		* Data administrator
		* Business contact

## Communication
* How will we keep in touch? Weekly meetings?
* Who are the contact persons on both sides?
