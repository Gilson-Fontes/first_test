## Identify Available Data Sources
* Extract (or obtain) and check sample data 
* Perform EDA (exploratory analysis, data dictionary)
* Assess quality of data, and value available in data
* Identify data glitches, find work-around
* Is quality and fields populated consistent over time?
* Are some fields a blend of different stuff (example: keyword field, sometimes equal to user query, sometimes to advertiser keyword, with no way to know except via statistical analyses or by talking to business people)
* How to improve data quality moving forward
* Do I need to create mini summary tables / database.
* Which tool do I need (R, Excel, Tableau, Python, Perl, Tableau, SAS and so on)
